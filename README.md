## Description
As a manager at an internet retail company, I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies. I built this project to test my knowledge of object-relational mapping used in back end web applications. Now the e-commerce website will have a back end that uses the latest tecnologies. I learned more about creating and testing routes as well as accessing a database using said routes during the project.

## Installation
The application can be installed by cloning the github repo, installing dependencies, running schema using mysql, running seeds, and creating a .env file to match your mySQL login information.

## Usage
After installation, the application can be ran by opening the integrated terminal and typing 'npm start'. The you can open insomnia and go to localhost:3001/<relativepath> to view and edit information from the database.

Here is a video demonstration on how the project works:

Testing was done in insomnia to ensure the routes were functioning properly
